As described in Section 8 of [TLS13], use of TLS early data comes with an exposure to replay attack. The use of 0-RTT in QUIC is similarly vulnerable to replay attack.

正如《[TLS13]()》的[第8章]()所述，使用了TLS早期数据就会被暴露于重放攻击之下。QUIC的0-RTT有着类似的风险。

Endpoints MUST implement and use the replay protections described in [TLS13], however it is recognized that these protections are imperfect. Therefore, additional consideration of the risk of replay is needed.

终端{{< req_level MUST >}}实现并使用《[TLS13]()》中描述的重放保护，然而这些保护并不被认为是完美的。因此，对于重放攻击的风险还需要更多考量。

QUIC is not vulnerable to replay attack, except via the application protocol information it might carry. The management of QUIC protocol state based on the frame types defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT] is not vulnerable to replay. Processing of QUIC frames is idempotent and cannot result in invalid connection states if frames are replayed, reordered, or lost. QUIC connections do not produce effects that last beyond the lifetime of the connection, except for those produced by the application protocol that QUIC serves.

QUIC并不易受到重放攻击，除非经由QUIC传递的应用协议信息来攻击。基于在《[QUIC传输]()》中定义的帧类型的QUIC协议状态管理机制不易受到重放攻击。QUIC帧的处理是幂等的，在帧被重放、乱序或遭遇丢包时不会引发连接状态异常。QUIC连接期间产生的副作用在连接的生命周期结束后就会失效，除非是那些由QUIC承载的应用协议产生的副作用。

TLS session tickets and address validation tokens are used to carry QUIC configuration information between connections, specifically, to enable a server to efficiently recover state that is used in connection establishment and address validation. These MUST NOT be used to communicate application semantics between endpoints; clients MUST treat them as opaque values. The potential for reuse of these tokens means that they require stronger protections against replay.

TLS会话票据和地址验证令牌被用于在不同的连接间传递QUIC配置信息，尤其是，它使得服务器能够在连接建立和地址验证时高效地恢复状态数据。{{< req_level MUST_NOT >}}使用它们在终端间传递应用语义；客户端{{< req_level MUST >}}将它们视作为不透明的值。如果这些令牌有可能被重用，那么它们就需要更强的针对重放攻击的保护。

A server that accepts 0-RTT on a connection incurs a higher cost than accepting a connection without 0-RTT. This includes higher processing and computation costs. Servers need to consider the probability of replay and all associated costs when accepting 0-RTT.

在某条连接上接受0-RTT的服务器比不接受0-RTT的服务器要消耗更多的计算资源。服务器在接受0-RTT时需要考虑到重放的可能性以及其他相关资源的消耗。

Ultimately, the responsibility for managing the risks of replay attacks with 0-RTT lies with an application protocol. An application protocol that uses QUIC MUST describe how the protocol uses 0-RTT and the measures that are employed to protect against replay attack. An analysis of replay risk needs to consider all QUIC protocol features that carry application semantics.

管理与0-RTT相关的重放攻击的风险，其最终的责任在于应用协议。使用QUIC的应用协议{{< req_level MUST >}}描述该协议会怎样使用0-RTT以及用于抵御重放攻击的手段。对于重放风险的分析需要考虑所有会传递应用语义的QUIC协议特性。

Disabling 0-RTT entirely is the most effective defense against replay attack.

要抵御重放攻击，完全禁用0-RTT是最有效的。

QUIC extensions MUST either describe how replay attacks affect their operation or prohibit the use of the extension in 0-RTT. Application protocols MUST either prohibit the use of extensions that carry application semantics in 0-RTT or provide replay mitigation strategies.

QUIC扩展{{< req_level MUST >}}描述重放攻击会如何影响扩展的行为，或禁止与0-RTT一起被使用。应用协议{{< req_level MUST >}}禁止使用会在0-RTT中传递应用语义的扩展，或提供抵御重放攻击的策略。
