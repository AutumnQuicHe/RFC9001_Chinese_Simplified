A small ClientHello that results in a large block of handshake messages from a server can be used in packet reflection attacks to amplify the traffic generated by an attacker.

如果一条较小的`ClientHello`（客户端问候）能使得服务器响应巨大的握手消息，它就能被用于数据包放大攻击，放大攻击者生成的流量。

QUIC includes three defenses against this attack. First, the packet containing a ClientHello MUST be padded to a minimum size. Second, if responding to an unverified source address, the server is forbidden to send more than three times as many bytes as the number of bytes it has received (see Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]). Finally, because acknowledgments of Handshake packets are authenticated, a blind attacker cannot forge them. Put together, these defenses limit the level of amplification.

QUIC针对此类攻击，拥有三种防御手段。首先，包含`ClientHello`的数据包{{< req_level MUST >}}被扩充至一个下限值。其次，在向未经验证的源地址响应时，服务器发送的字节数禁止超过它接收到的字节数的三倍（详见《[QUIC传输]()》的[第8.1章]()）。最后，因为对于握手数据包的确认是经认证的，所有对此一无所知的攻击者无法伪造它们。综合起来，这些防御手段限制了放大攻击的放大量级。
