An attacker could guess values for packet numbers or Key Phase and have an endpoint confirm guesses through timing side channels. Similarly, guesses for the packet number length can be tried and exposed. If the recipient of a packet discards packets with duplicate packet numbers without attempting to remove packet protection, they could reveal through timing side channels that the packet number matches a received packet. For authentication to be free from side channels, the entire process of header protection removal, packet number recovery, and packet protection removal MUST be applied together without timing and other side channels.

攻击者可以猜测数据包号或密钥阶段的值，并通过计时侧信道观察终端会不会接受这个值。类似地，对于数据包号长度也可以进行猜测和破解。如果数据包的接收方直接将数据包号重复的数据包丢弃，而没有尝试移除数据包保护，那么它们就会通过计时侧信道暴露此数据包号与一个已接收到的数据包匹配的事实。为了使认证与侧信道无关，{{< req_level MUST >}}完整进行移除头部保护、恢复数据包号和移除数据包保护的全部过程，并且避免从计时或其他方面的侧信道泄露信息。

For the sending of packets, construction and protection of packet payloads and packet numbers MUST be free from side channels that would reveal the packet number or its encoded size.

在数据包的发送方面，数据包载荷与数据包号的构建和保护过程{{< req_level MUST >}}不会从侧信道泄露数据包号或它的编码后长度。

During a key update, the time taken to generate new keys could reveal through timing side channels that a key update has occurred. Alternatively, where an attacker injects packets, this side channel could reveal the value of the Key Phase on injected packets. After receiving a key update, an endpoint SHOULD generate and save the next set of receive packet protection keys, as described in Section 6.3. By generating new keys before a key update is received, receipt of packets will not create timing signals that leak the value of the Key Phase.

在密钥更新期间，创建新密钥所花费的时间可能通过计时侧信道泄露密钥更新的发生。除此之外，当攻击者注入数据包时，该侧信道会泄露被注入数据包里密钥阶段的值。在接收到密钥更新后，终端{{< req_level SHOULD >}}如[第6.3章]()所述的那样，建立并储存下一组接受用的数据包保护密钥。通过在接收到密钥更新前就建立新密钥，数据包的接收不会创建会泄露密钥阶段的值的计时上的信号。

This depends on not doing this key generation during packet processing, and it can require that endpoints maintain three sets of packet protection keys for receiving: for the previous key phase, for the current key phase, and for the next key phase. Endpoints can instead choose to defer generation of the next receive packet protection keys until they discard old keys so that only two sets of receive keys need to be retained at any point in time.

这项要求依赖于不在数据包处理期间建立新密钥，同时它可能需要终端维护三组接收用的数据包保护密钥：上一密钥阶段的、当前密钥阶段的和下一密钥阶段的。作为替代方案，终端可以选择延迟建立下一密钥阶段的数据包保护密钥，直到它弃用旧密钥为止，这使得它在同一时间只需要维护两组接收密钥。
